# VEGA.foundation website
A single-page, cinematic landing experience inspired by VEGA.foundation. The site showcases vision, services, team, and a contact form with responsive, glassmorphic styling that adapts from mobile to ultra-wide screens.

## Getting started
Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the directory locally (for example, with `python -m http.server`). All assets are self-contained in the `assets` folder.
