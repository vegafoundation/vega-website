# Vega website

A lightweight, single-page marketing site for the Vega data platform. The page highlights product pillars, solutions for different teams, social proof, and calls to action.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the directory locally (for example, with `python -m http.server`). All assets are self-contained in the `assets` folder.
